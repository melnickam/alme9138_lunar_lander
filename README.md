# alme9138_lunar_lander
3202 Final Project


This was the final project for my Introduction to Artifical Intelligence class.

I used DQN to attempt to teach a reinforcement learning agent how to successfully land the lunar lander in the game of the same name.

The project uses the box2d environment in OpenAI's gym.

A fuller narrative is included in the jupyter notebook.
